# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

In building this dashboard, I created individual pages for each plot and a means by which that you can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations with a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

### Website Requirements

The website must consist of 7 pages using Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS:

* A [landing page] containing:
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There is a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.
* Four [visualization pages], each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.
* A ["Comparisons" page] that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.
* A ["Data" page]that:
  * Displays a responsive table using Bootstrap that contains the data used in the visualizations.
