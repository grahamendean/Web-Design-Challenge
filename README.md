# Web-Design-Challenge
On this project I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Javascript to create a website that held weather data.

I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations created in a past projects. Specifically, I plotted weather data.

In building this dashboard, I create individual pages for each plot and a means by which you can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.
